        Lasagna Ingredients The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe
        because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the
        ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the
        original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to
        your grocery list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
          sausage and lean ground beef.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic
          are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed
          tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
          sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is
          flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian
          seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
          noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese
          make this lasagna extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
          out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
        </li>

      <p><b>Steps :</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients. Heat a deep cast iron skillet over medium
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season chicken breasts with salt, garlic, and Italian seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour 2 teaspoons oil into the skillet. Once hot, add chicken. Cook
          until golden, turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Move chicken to
          one side of the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour remaining oil into the skillet. Add minced shallot; cook until
          softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, stir until fragrant, about
          1 minute
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the crushed tomatoes, salt, sugar, red pepper flakes, and basil.
          Pour in chicken broth and wine. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add pasta to the skillet. Nestle chicken pieces on top of pasta.
          Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover, and cook until pasta is tender with
          a bite, about 8 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning; serve
          immediately.
